three primary collection types

Mutability of Collections

Arrays

 - Array Type Shorthand Syntax

 - Creating an Empty Array

   > create an empty array of a certain type using initializer syntax

   > you can create an empty array with an empty array literal

 - Creating an Array with a Default Value

 - Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together

 - Creating an Array with an Array Literal

 - Accessing and Modifying an Array

   > To find out the number of items in an array

   > checking whether the count property is equal to 0

   > add a new item to the end of an array

   > append an array with the addition assignment operator

   > Retrieve a value from the array by using subscript syntax

   > You can use subscript syntax to change an existing value

   > You can also use subscript syntax to change a range of values at once

   > you remove an item from the array

   > remove the final item from an array

 - Iterating Over an Array

   > for in

   > If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the enumerate() method


Sets

 - Hash Values for Set Types

 - Set Type Syntax

 - Creating and Initializing an Empty Set

   > create an empty set of a certain type using initializer syntax

   > create an empty set with an empty array literal

 - Creating a Set with an Array Literal

 - Accessing and Modifying a Set

   > find out the number of items in a set

   > checking whether the count property is equal to 0

   > add a new item into a set by calling the set’s ? method

   > remove an item from a set by calling ? method

   > check whether a set contains a particular item

 - Iterating Over a Set

   > for in

   > iterate over the values of a set in a specific order


Performing Set Operations

 - Fundamental Set Operations - 4 methods

 - Set Membership and Equality - 6 methods


Dictionaries

 - Dictionary Type Shorthand Syntax

 - Creating an Empty Dictionary

   > create an empty dictionary with an empty dictionary literal

 - Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal

 - Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary

   > find out the number of items in a Dictionary

   > checking whether the count property is equal to 0

   > add a new item to a dictionary with subscript syntax

   > use subscript syntax to change the value associated with a particular key

   > use a dictionary’s updateValue(_:forKey:) method to set or update the value for a particular key

   > use subscript syntax to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary

   > Alternatively, remove a key-value pair from a dictionary with the removeValueForKey(_:) method

 - Iterating Over a Dictionary

   > for in

   > iterable collection of a dictionary’s keys

   > iterable collection of a dictionary’s values

   > initialize a new array with the keys or values property
